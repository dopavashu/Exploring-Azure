#Creating the VM in Azure 

if your making a VM then you may have faced these three option likely ,and you may confuse so clear your POV with esay points.
Let's break down where you'd use each of these Azure VM options:

**1. Azure Virtual Machine (Create a virtual machine hosted by Azure)**

* **Use Cases:**
    * **Full Customization:** This option is for when you need complete control over your virtual machine's configuration. You define everything: operating system, CPU, memory, storage, networking, and security settings.
    * **Specific Software Requirements:** If your application requires a particular operating system version, specific drivers, or custom software configurations, this is the way to go.
    
**2. Azure Virtual Machine with Preset Configuration (Create a virtual machine with presets based on your workloads)**

* **Use Cases:**
    * **Simplified Deployment:** This option streamlines the VM creation process by offering pre-configured templates optimized for common workloads.
    * **Web Servers:** Quickly deploy VMs configured for hosting websites or web applications.
   
    * **Development Environments:** Get pre-configured VMs for specific development stacks, like Database server [ mysql ] .NET or Java.

# Azure Virtual Machine Setup - Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS

This document outlines the steps to create an Azure Virtual Machine running Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS in the Central India region, configured with specific settings.

## Setup Process

Follow these steps to deploy the virtual machine:

1.  **Navigate to Azure Portal:**
    * Log in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com).
    * Search for "Virtual machines" and select it.
    * Click "Create" -> "Azure virtual machine".

2.  **Basics Tab:**
    * **Subscription:** Choose your desired Azure subscription.
    * **Resource group:** Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
    * **Virtual machine name:** Enter a descriptive name for your VM (e.g., `ubuntu-server-2404`).
    * **Region:** Select "(Asia Pacific) Central India".
    * **Availability options:**
        * Choose "Availability zone".
        * **Zone options:** Select "Self-selected zone".
        * **Availability zone:** Select "Zone 1".
        * **Security type:** Select "Trusted launch virtual machines".
    * **Image:**
        * Click "See all images".
        * Search for and select "Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2".
    * **VM architecture:** Select "x64".
    * **Run with Azure Spot discount:** Choose whether to use Spot instances (for cost savings, but may be interrupted).
    * **Size:**
        * Click "See all sizes".
        * Select "Standard_E4s_v3 - 4 vcpus, 32 GiB memory".
    * **Enable Hibernation:** Leave unchecked, as it is incompatible with Trusted launch and Linux images in this configuration.

3.  **Administrator Account:**
    * **Authentication type:** Choose "SSH public key" or "Password".
        * **SSH Public Key (Recommended):**
            * Enter your SSH public key in the provided field.
            * Ensure your private key is kept safe.
        * **Password:**
            * Enter a username.
            * Enter and confirm a strong password.
    * **Note:** SSH public keys are generally more secure than passwords.

4.  **Disks, Networking, Management, Advanced, and Tags Tabs:**
    * Configure these tabs according to your specific requirements. If you're unsure, you can leave the default settings.
    * **Disks:** Configure your OS and data disks.
    * **Networking:** Configure your virtual network, subnet, and public IP.
    * **Management:** Configure boot diagnostics, OS guest diagnostics, and auto-shutdown.
    * **Advanced:** Configure extensions, custom data, and proximity placement groups.
    * **Tags:** Add tags for resource organization and billing.

5.  **Review + create:**
    * Review the configuration summary.
    * Click "Create" to deploy the virtual machine.

## Instance Details

* **Virtual machine name:** `ubuntu-server-2404` (or your chosen name)
* **Region:** (Asia Pacific) Central India
* **Availability zone:** Zone 1
* **Security type:** Trusted launch virtual machines
* **Image:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2
* **VM architecture:** x64
* **Size:** Standard_E4s_v3 - 4 vcpus, 32 GiB memory

## Important Notes

* **SSH Key Security:** If using SSH keys, ensure your private key is stored securely.
* **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** After deployment, configure NSGs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to necessary ports.
* **Cost Management:** Monitor the VM's cost in the Azure portal to avoid unexpected charges.
* **Azure Selected Zone:** The Azure-selected zone is not supported in central india at this time.
* **Hibernation:** Hibernation is not compatible with trusted launch and linux images in this configuration.

**3. More VMs and Related Solutions (Discover and deploy full workloads and Azure products for your business needs)**

* **Use Cases:**
    * **Complex Solutions:** This option is for deploying comprehensive solutions that involve multiple VMs and other Azure services.
    * **Marketplace Solutions:** Deploy pre-built solutions from the Azure Marketplace, such as virtual firewalls, load balancers, or pre-configured software stacks.
    * **Azure Services Integration:** Deploy solutions that integrate VMs with other Azure services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure SQL Database, or Azure Active Directory.
